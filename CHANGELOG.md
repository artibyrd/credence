## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- **Multi-Cloud Production Deployment**: Provisioned and live-verified GCP Cloud Run v2 (`credence-server`) and Cloudflare multi-domain edge routing.
- **FastMCP 2.0 Live SSE Endpoint**: Real-time Server-Sent Events streaming on `https://mcp.credence.run/sse` with session assignment and CORS preflight handling.
- **Zero-Build Multi-Domain Edge Router**: Cloudflare Worker (`_worker.js`) routing across `credence.run`, `credence.nexus`, `credence.foundation`, and `credence.report` with 0 npm dependencies.
- **Air-Gapped Genesis Root Key Ceremony**: Generated network root Ed25519 keypair and published canonical RFC 8785 signed `peers.json` and pinned `root.pub`.
- **Streamlined Operator Justfile Recipes**: Added `just gcp-build`, `just tf-plan`, `just tf-apply`, and `just seed-sync` for one-command deployment.
- **Hermetic Documentation Integrity Test Suite**: Added `tests/test_docs_integrity.py` validating 47 docs, 7 interactive widgets, and zero-npm compliance in <0.1s.
- **Platform Portability Specifications**: 5 comprehensive specifications for multi-model adapters (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, local Ollama) and multi-cloud deployment (AWS, Azure, Hetzner, K8s).
- **Interactive Model Cost Comparator**: Section 7 in `docs/playground.md` for real-time model cost, latency, and sovereignty trade-off analysis.

### Changed
- **Hostname-Aware Dynamic Routing**: Decoupled `docs.credence.run` (technical documentation portal) and `blog.credence.run` (sovereign editorial publication) within a unified zero-build engine.
- **Token Safety Governor**: Updated model tiering to pin `gemini-3.7-flash` as primary reasoning engine across `BALANCED` and `ULTRA` profiles with thinking token budgets ($1,024 \dots 16,384$).

### Fixed
- **Transport Security Host Header Validation**: Configured `TransportSecuritySettings` on FastMCP SSE app to allow public domain proxies and Cloudflare CDN headers without `Invalid Host` rejections.
- **Asset Boundary Protection**: Configured `.assetsignore` and `binding = "ASSETS"` in `web/wrangler.toml` to prevent Cloudflare Worker build errors.

- **Verbatim Grounding Validator**: Whitespace-insensitive character-offset citation verification ($G=1.0$) with 50% slash penalty on hallucinated quotes.
- **P2P Mesh Network Engine**: 13-node Watts-Strogatz small-world gossip diffusion, Bayesian consensus aggregator, and Byzantine fault tolerance ($3f+1$).
- **The Galileo Rule**: Asymmetric evidence weighting preventing Sybil cartels from overriding verified domain authorities.
- **Zero-Build Web UI & Textual TUI**: Vanilla HTML5/ES modules web suite and interactive terminal workstation (`credence tui`).
